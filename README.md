## Getting Started

- You will require about **3 GB of free disk space** &#x2757;
- Make sure you have Git installed in your terminal &#x2757;

Start by cloning locally the repository of the challenge by running this command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MALAPA-Collab/cheetah-tutorial-2025
```

Then enter the downloaded repository:

```bash
cd cheetah-tutorial-2025
```

### Installing virtual environment

#### Using conda-forge

- If you don't have conda installed already, you can install the `miniforge` as described in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) or download from the [conda-forge site](https://conda-forge.org/download/). Once `miniforge` is installed, you can use the `conda` commands as usual.
- We recommend installing `miniforge` the day beforehand to avoid network overload during the challenge &#x2757; &#x2757;

Once `miniforge` is installed run this command in your terminal:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Afterwards, activate the environment with `conda activate malapa-cheetah-tutorial-2025`

Now you should be able to run the provided notebook.

## Running the tutorial

After installing the package

You can start the jupyter notebook in the terminal, and it will start a browser automatically

```bash
python -m jupyter notebook
```

Alternatively, you can use supported Editor to run the jupyter notebooks, e.g. with VS Code.
